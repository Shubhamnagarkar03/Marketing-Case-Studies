          Buy one pack of biscuits online and watch what happens. The platforms layer delivery fees,

          This isn't a bug — it's engineered. The "small cart fee" exists to push you to add more items, 
          lifting average order value for the platform. Your kirana charges none of this. Ever.

          When the bhaji wala lost to a 10-minute delivery, something else got lost too: 
          the walk. The interaction. The decision. A 2025 Cureus study from Kolkata found that 
          frequent food delivery app users showed significantly higher rates of sedentary behaviour, 
          overeating, and emotional eating compared to low-frequency and in-store buyers.

        <p class="verdict-para">
          Online delivery is genuinely useful — for a narrow, urban, time-pressed 5–8% of India who can 
          absorb the fee stack and don't mind being nudged into larger baskets. For everyone else, 
          the kirana isn't a legacy system. It's the incumbent with better margins, human credit, 
          zero delivery fees, and 12 million locations.
        </p>
        <p class="verdict-para">
          The sector built extraordinary infrastructure. But infrastructure isn't habit. 
          Zomato's flatline MTU, Swiggy's widening losses, ONDC's transaction collapse the moment 
          subsidies dried up — these aren't bumps. They're the market telling the truth.
        </p>
        <p class="verdict-para">
          Until platforms solve pricing parity, Tier 2+ viability, and a vendor ecosystem that isn't 
          held hostage by 30–40% commissions, the bhaji wala outside your building remains 
          the most efficient last-mile commerce system India has ever built.
